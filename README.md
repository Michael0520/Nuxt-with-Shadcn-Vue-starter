# Nuxt with Shadcn Vue starter
An opinionated Nuxt 3 starter template with components built with Radix-Vue. This is my personal port of the shadcn/ui library.

## Installation
- To install, run pnpm install
- To start the development server, run pnpm run dev

## Features
- Incorporates **VueUse** for utility functions
- Utilizes **Zod** for TypeScript-first schema validation and parsing
